**Overview**

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and models developed for the AI Hackathon. The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to address a specific challenge.

**Project Components**

1. **Medical Subfolder**

The medical subfolder contains the software implementation, including:

**api.py:** Backend API for interfacing with the machine learning model.

**myModel.pickle** and **myModel.pkl**: Trained machine learning models.

**.gitignore, .mvn, .vscode:** Configuration files for version control and environment setup.

**pom.xml**: Maven configuration file indicating dependencies and build settings.

**src**: Source code directory.

**target**: Compiled files or binaries.

**Features**

**Machine Learning Models**: Includes decision tree and ensemble approaches.

**API Integration**: Backend API for seamless interaction with the models.

**Reports and Documentation**: Comprehensive documents detailing the project.

**Scalable Architecture**: Maven-based project for robust build and deployment.

Getting Started
